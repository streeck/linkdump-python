# Linkdump Python
 
It's a simple project from 'eiguike' done in C that dumps every single hypertext link from a given URL to a log.txt file.
I thought it would be cool to try it out in Python.
 
## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/streeck/linkdump-python.git`

or you can simply download the linkdump.py file to a desired folder in your machine.
 
## Usage
 
1. Open terminal and type: `python linkdump.py http://copypastedurl.com/`
2. Open `log.txt` file created by the script.
3. Profit!
